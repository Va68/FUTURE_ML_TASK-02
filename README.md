# FUTURE_ML_02 - Customer Churn Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting customer churn using **Machine Learning models** and visualizing insights with **Power BI**. The aim is to identify patterns in customer behavior that lead to churn and provide actionable insights to reduce it.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Power BI (Dashboard & Visualizations)
- GitHub for version control

## 📂 Project Tasks
- **Data Preprocessing** (cleaning, handling nulls, encoding categorical values)  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to identify churn patterns  
- **ML Model Building** (classification models for churn prediction)  
- **Power BI Dashboard** showing:  
  - Churn by Gender  
  - Churn by Contract Type  
  - Churn by Internet Service  

## 📊 Key Insights
- Higher churn observed among **Month-to-Month contract users**  
- **Fiber optic internet customers** show higher churn compared to DSL  
- New customers with lower tenure are more likely to churn  

## 🚀 Outcome
Built a machine learning model that predicts customer churn and created an interactive Power BI dashboard for better visualization of churn insights.
